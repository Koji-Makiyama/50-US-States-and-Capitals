This is the README.md for my 50-US-States-and-Capitals SQL query file. Running this .sql query file will create a database and table with the US states, capitals, and  acronyms!
Feel free to open the SQL file in your preferred IDE or Notepad!\
If you are learning SQL with MariaDB and are trying to learn how to use a given expression, I recommend Googling "Mariadb (the expression) syntax".\
I have licensed this as an MIT license, i.e. an open source license.\
